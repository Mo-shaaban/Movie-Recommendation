# Movie-Recommendation
Used machine learning to recommend movies to users based on their watching history

used a data set from (ttps://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)pecificaly the MovieLens 1M Dataset. Manipulated the data so I can use k-means clustering algorithm
to put the movies in different clusters based on their genres and then got average rating for all movies. Based on every users watching history and good recommendation
I will suggest 2 movies in the same genres with an overall rating of 4 or more, suggesting 10 movies for each of the 610 users at the end.
