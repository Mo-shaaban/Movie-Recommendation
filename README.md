# Movie-Recommendation
Used machine learning to recommend movies to users based on their watching history

used a data set from (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users.
Manipulated the data so I can use k-means clustering algorithm to put the movies in different clusters based on their genres and then got average rating for all movies. Based on every users watching history and good recommendation I will suggest 2 movies in the same genres with an overall rating of 4 or more, suggesting 10 movies for each of the 610 users at the end.
